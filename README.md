[nVotes][electionguard sdk] Verifier enables the verification of election
ballots, tallies, and proofs generated by an election run using the
ElectionGuard SDK. It has been developed independently by nVotes Team and is
written in typescript.

**WARNING**: This software is in development and is incomplete and most probably
contains bugs. Please do not use in production.

## Building

This is a typescript project and uses the standard typescript toolchain.
Install dependencies with:

```bash
npm install
```

Then you can build the project into javascript to the `build/` directory with:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can execute the unit tests with:

```bash
npm run test
```

You can generate package documentation with:

```bash
npm run doc
```

## Running

You can run the verifier through the command line using `node`:

```bash
node build/src/bin/verifier.js $PATH_TO_ELECTION_RECORD.json
```

There are multiple election record examples in the directory `test/data` that
you can use with the verifier. For example, the following command should verify
correctly the `valid_encrypted.json` election record, which contains a valid
election record:

```bash
node build/src/bin/verifier.js tests/data/valid_encrypted.json
```

## Development

Note that we autogenerate both:

- The file `json_schemas.ts` (in directory `vendor/electionguard-schema-0.85`)
  that contains the schemas as an object, so that they can be directly loaded
  as a javascript dependency and not opening json files.
- The schema definitions in directory `vendor/electionguard-schema-0.85/@types`,
  so that the election record to be verified can be loaded from json in a typed
  manner.

When required, you can update the two generated json schemas derivatives
mentioned above by running:

```bash
npm run generate_election_record_types
```

## Dependencies

The verifier uses minimal runtime dependencies to be very self-contained:

- [verificatum-vjsc]: Self-contained javascript cryptographic library for use
  in electronic voting clients. Developed and maintained by Douglas Wikstr√∂m
  and part of the [Verificatum project]. It's directly included in the
  `vendors` directory.
- [ajv]: A JSON Schema draft-07 validator, as the verifiable data is in JSON
  and the [ElectionGuard SDK Specification] includes the
  [JSON Schema of the election record]. We have directly extracted and copied
  verbatim these schemas in the `vendors` directory.
- [@types/node] The definitions for node.js, required to process command-line
  arguments in the command-line verifier.

There is a bunch of other development-only additional dependencies. These are
not really relevant other than for development purposes:

- [jest]: typescript-friendy testing framework.
- [coveralls]: generates test coverage reports.
- [typedoc]: Generates package documentation.
- [json-schema-to-typescript]: Compile json schema to typescript typings.
- [eslint]: A linting library.
- [@typescript-eslint/parser]: A parser that allows ESLint to lint TypeScript code.
- [@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin]: A plugin that contains some ESLint rules that are TypeScript specific.
- [prettier]: The core prettier library.
- [eslint-config-prettier]: Disables ESLint rules that might conflict with prettier.
- [eslint-plugin-prettier]: Runs prettier as an ESLint rule.
- [link-staged]: Allows to run linting commands on files that are staged to be committed.
- [husky]: Makes git hooks simpler to use.
